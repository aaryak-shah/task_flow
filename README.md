# TaskFlow

A Flutter application to track and boost your productivity! You can create tasks, projects and goals using the app and track your time utilization throughout the day. Create an account, or use the app as a guest to get started. After creating some tasks, goals and projects, you can use the Statistics section of the app to visualize your data and get insights about it. The data analysis is performed using a Flask API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/gautamanirudh/task_flow_api).

This app is still under development.
